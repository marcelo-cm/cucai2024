The website for Canada's largest undergraduate conference on AI.

# Canadian Undergraduate Conference on AI
We are a not-for-profit conference that bring together over 320 of the brightest minds on AI from across the country. 100% run by undergraduate volunteers, out of passion.

Since our inception in 2018, CUCAI has hosted distinguished speakers, such as Geoffrey Hinton, Shivon Zilis, and Ivan Zhang. The conference serves as a platform for top Canadian undergraduates in AI to learn, share their passion, and connect with industry leaders.

Our main event is the AI project showcase where teams from all Canadian universities demo their project in front of recruiters, sponsors, speakers & their fellow delegates.

CUCAI 2024 will be in Kingston, ON on March 2-3, 2024. Hotels included in ticket price.
